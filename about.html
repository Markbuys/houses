	<h1>A bit more about me</h1>

	<p>I've spent the last 10 years using technology to bring people together and attempting to make the world a better place.</p> 

	<p>That's meant everything from helping to elect a a President to starting a venture-backed startup.</p> 

	<p>Some of these efforts have worked better than I would have ever dreamed, and others....not so much.</p>

	<p>A few of the highlights:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>At MoveOn, the team I led developed new approach to field organizing. Traditionally, national field networks be expensive, beaucratic and slow. By leveraging online tools and handing most of the responsiblity over to our members, we were able to rapidly build a national network with a super small organizing team, while matching the rapid pace of online campaigns. This all meant that we were able to do things like organize press conferences in 200 cities, with a week's notice.</li>
	
	<li>I also helped to design and run MoveOn's 2006 and 2008 electoral campaigns. Through these campaigns we played a huge role in taking back the House and the Senate, and electing President Obama.</li>

	<li>As the Founding Director at New Media Ventures, I launched the country's first network of progressive angel investors and helped to mainstream the idea that you can work to create political change, and have a for-profit business model.</li> 

	<li>Most recently, I headed up marketing and operations as co-founder of Scoot Networks, the world's first network of shared electric scooters. I helped the organization grow from the germ of an idea to a fully operational network with dozens of electric scooters parked all around San Francisco and thousands of happy customers. Creating a brand new form of transportation is quite difficult, and I'm incredibly proud of the work our team did, and continues to</li>
