Super Simple Personal Page
===================

This is a really easy to use template for creating a simple personal page (basically an opensource about.me.). It's made for anyone who wants to create a home on the internets, but doesn't want to deal with ads or freemiums. If you host this on github (like I am), than the whole thing is free.  

This started as a project to build a page for my wife, and update my front end development skills, but I realized that it was pretty generalizable. So, here we are. This project is licensed with the MIT license so feel free to use it freely.

If you already know what you're doing, feel free to fork the code and get going. 

If you're just learning about code and/or github, follow the instructions below:

##Set up a github account##
If you don't have an account yet, create one and select the free plan option.

##Fork this code##
The next step is moving the code over to your account. Github makes this super easy. Just click the "fork" button on the top left. It's now moved from my repository to yours. 

##Rename the repository##
Now we're going to get you set up to host your site on Github. The first step is renaming the repository, using their Github's specific naming format.

You can change the repository name by clicking on the "settings" tab on the right of the screen. Once you're there you should change the name to: username.github.io. For me that's mattewing.github.io. Your username is whatever you used when you created the account. You should also change the branch to "master".
